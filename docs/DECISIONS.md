## 2026-08-10: Use a real video stream

Status: accepted

The active paradigm processes each real video frame once. The first frame
initializes five layer states. Later frames inherit the previous five layer
states, predictions, and dynamic errors. State is reset only at a true sequence
boundary.

Training and validation must preserve drive and frame order. Stream mode uses
batch size 1 and does not permit shuffled frame pairs.

## 2026-08-10: Cancel repeated timesteps on one image

Status: accepted

The old design that ran one static image through multiple model timesteps is no
longer an active research route. It must not be used as the implementation or
interpretation of continuous video state.

## 2026-08-10: Separate mechanism validation from generalization

Status: accepted

The two downloaded KITTI drives are used first for tightly controlled
comparisons. More drives are downloaded only after state inheritance and
dynamic error show a stable advantage over their controls. Two-drive results
are preliminary mechanism evidence, not a broad generalization claim.

## 2026-08-10: Keep research history durable

Status: accepted

Every meaningful code update should include a user-readable explanation and,
when relevant, updates to `PROJECT_STATE.md` or `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`. Every
reported experiment should identify the Git commit, data split, configuration,
best epoch, metrics, and artifact location.
